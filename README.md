# MojoNote
Cross-platform notes for desktop

Cross between windows Notes and Mac Stickies.  
Master list window, showing all the notes, hidden by default.  
General aesthetics of Mac Stickies, but instead of a delete/close button, there is a menu button.  
Want to only accept plain text from any source, no formatting whatsoever.  
I use this for coding, and use it to strip any formatting from the text I drop in.
I use Linux, Raspian, Windows, Mac, and would like the same general experience across devices.  
Will be using PyQT5
Not even close yet, and will require a lot of restructuring. I'm just posting current status.
