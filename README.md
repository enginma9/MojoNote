# Sticks2All
Cross-platform notes for your desktop

A cross between windows Notes and Mac Stickies.  
Master list window, showing all the notes, hidden by default.  
General aesthetics of Mac Stickies, but instead of a delete/close button, there is a menu button.  
Want to only accept plain text from any source, no formatting whatsoever.  
I use this for coding, and would like to use it to strip any formatting from the text I drop in.
I use Linux, Raspian, Windows, Mac, and would like the same general experience across devices.  
Will be using PyQT5, and the only window to be shown on task bar should be the QMainWindow.  
It's not even close yet, and will require a lot of restructuring. I'm just posting current status.
